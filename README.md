# Guitar-Chord-Diagram-Generator

In this web app you can create chords that you would play on a guitar or even a bass. To use this, select the number of strings that correspond to the instrument you are playing, it goes anywhere from 4 to 8 strings. From there, you can select the tuning you are using. If you are using a capo, you can choose where it is placed. Lastly, choose the fret that you'd want your chord to start from.

After you've set up how you want your fretboard, select the notes that you want to be played. If you want to mute an open string, click on the circle to make it an "x" which means it is muted. When you've selected the notes you are satisfied with, an algorithm I made will give you several options of chord names from a drop down menu that can represent the chord you have made. Feel free to choose one of those or make your own name for it. 

You can even change the color of everything as you desire.
