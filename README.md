# Guitar-Chord-Diagram-Generator

With this, you can create diagrams for chords that you'd play on a guitar (or even a bass).

To use, select the number of strings that correspond to the instrument you're playing; it goes anywhere from four to eight strings. From there, you can select the tuning you're using. If you are using a capo, you can choose where to place it. Lastly, choose the fret you want the chord to start from.

Now you're able to select the notes that you want played in your chord. To mute an open string, click the corresponding circle to make it an "x" which means it's muted. After selecting notes, a dropdown will show several choices of chord names that reflect the chord you've made. Additionally, you can make your own name for the chord if you so choose.

You can change the color scheme as you see fit.
